<h1>JULY MOVIE LIST</h1>
<h2>The first three that come to my mind</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Asteroid City</h3>
<p>another Wes Anderson movie with his signature technique but this time, reminds of Fellini's Otto e Messo
<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>funny parody of Barbie</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>Just too long to watch</p>
